# The Secret Store

The Secret Store is a platform to share and synchronize your project configuration environment variables with your team without having to send a bunch of e-mails back and forth with simple commands like in git. It's Forever FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). You can fork and create your copy, and utilize it for your personal / internal use within your organization.
